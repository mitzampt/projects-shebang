#This repository is a collection of scripts and code in order to tie a toolchain to software projects contained within one file.
#One file should describe the code as well as the means to:
make -the project
compile -to binary 
link -the libs
debug -the binary
install 
env builtin-unit-testing

#solution should range from simple shebang short-hand lines to fully preprocessed shebang (#!) markup
